We are delivering a new release with several bugfixes and improvements. Below we list the most important or interesting changes, without mentioning the several bugfixes. For details visit the [release's notes](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.3.0). Breaking changes are marked with ⚠️.

## Stats

In this release we included [XXX PRs since the 1.2.2 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.3.0) by XXX contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language and its stdlib! ❤️

## Interpreter

## Windows Support

## Unicode

## Syscalls

## Multi-Assign

Multiple assignments got improved in various ways. First, it's possible to take a "splat of elements" in a multi-assignment:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
n_first, *n_s, n_last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]       # n_s is [2, 3, 4]
*t_s, t_last = {"This", 15, 4, "tuple", true} # t_s is {"This", 15, 4, "tuple"}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

Second, it's possible to detect unbalanced multi-assignments:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
not, that, many = [1, 2]    # Multiple assignment count mismatch (IndexError)
{% endhighlight %}</div>

⚠️ This second improvement is a breaking change; therefore, you need to enable it with the flag `-Dstrict_multi_assign`. We encourage to do so to detect possible errors in your code, and to prepare to 2.0, which likely will include it by default. An additional restriction guarded by that flag is that if the right-hand side has a unique element, it must be of type `Indexable` or `Enumerable`.

## Number Autocast

## Improved Numerical Support / Lexing Number Literals
