## Interpreter

## Windows Support

## Unicode

## Multi-Assign

## Number Autocast

## Improved Numerical Support / Lexing Number Literals

## Other notable changes

- ⚠️ Methods that enumerate on a subrange now always use `start` as parameter name for the begin of the subrange ([#11350](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11350)). This was standardized from several different forms, which keep working as deprecated overloads until the next major release.
- ⚠️ More refactorings happend to `Indexable::Mutable#fill`'s overloads ([#11368](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11368)). Again, existing code continues to work with deprecated overloads.
- ⚠️ `Regex#name_table` returns `Hash(Int32, String)` instead of `Hash(Int16, String)` ([#11539](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11539)). Noticable effects are pretty limited due to number autocasting.
