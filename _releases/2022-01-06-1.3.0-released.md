## Stats

In this release we included [XXX PRs since the 1.2.2 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.3.0) by XXX contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language and its stdlib! ❤️

## Interpreter

## Windows Support

## Unicode

## Syscalls

We added an experimental API to create native system calls ([#10777](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10777)). Only Linux is supported for now. This is a first step towards supporting Linux's `io_uring` interface to improve IO performance.

To define system calls open a module and use the [`Syscall.def_syscall`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/Syscall.html#def_syscall%28name%2Creturn_type%2C%2Aargs%29-macro) macro. As demonstrated in the following example, you need to pass in the system call name, the return type and its arguments.

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
require "syscall"

module MySyscalls
  Syscall.def_syscall write, Int32, fd : Int32, buf : UInt8*, count : LibC::SizeT
end

data = "Hello!\n"
MySyscalls.write(1, data.to_unsafe, LibC::SizeT.new(data.size))
{% endhighlight %}</div>

## Multi-Assign

## Number Autocast

## Improved Numerical Support / Lexing Number Literals
