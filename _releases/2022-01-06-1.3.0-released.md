We are delivering a new release with several bugfixes and improvements. Below we list the most important or interesting changes, without mentioning the several bugfixes. For details visit the [release's notes](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.3.0). Breaking changes are marked with ⚠️.

## Stats

In this release we included [XXX PRs since the 1.2.2 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.3.0) by XXX contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language and its stdlib! ❤️

## Interpreter

## Windows Support

## Unicode

## Syscalls

## Multi-Assign

## Number Autocast

Primitive numeric values are now _autocasted_ to fit into larger types. For instance, it is possible to call a function expecting an `Int64` with an `Int32`:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
def foo(x : Int64)
  x
end

bar = 1_i32
foo(bar)
{% endhighlight %}</div>

Unsigned integer types can be autocasted into larger signed ones. And autocasting also works for floating point types (`Float32` to `Float64`).

If there is ambiguity, for instance, because there are more than one option, the compiler throws an error:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
def foo(x : Int64)
  x
end

def foo(x : Int128)
  x
end

bar = 1_i32

foo(bar) # Error: ambiguous call, implicit cast of Int32 matches all of Int64, Int128
{% endhighlight %}</div>

## Improved Numerical Support / Lexing Number Literals
