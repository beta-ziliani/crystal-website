If you been paying attention to what's happening with [multi-threading support in Crystal](./2024-02-09-84codes-manas-mt.md), you'll note that a name stands out: Julien Portalier. Also known as [@ysbaddaden](https://github.com/ysbaddaden), he was part of the Crystal Core Team until 2019. Now that he's taken on such a critical task, it only makes sense to bring him back to the Core Team.

Welcome back, Julien! For many more years crystallizing!
