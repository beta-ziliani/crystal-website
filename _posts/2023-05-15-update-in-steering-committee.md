title: "Changes in the Steering Committee"
author: nditada
summary: Juan Wajnerman is stepping down from his position, with Beta Ziliani taking his place.
---

Juan Wajnerman has been involved with Crystal since its very beginning, and has served as one of the three Steering Committee members (the other two being Ary Borenzweig and Brian Cardiff). However, he decided to move on with his personal projects and leave this position. Beta Ziliani, who's been leading the development of the language for the past two years, will now take his seat.

We consider ourselves lucky to have shared paths with Juan, a great colleague with fine technical qualities that make him stand out. Our doors will forever be open in case he decides to return to share his knowledge with the community for the language he helped grow.
