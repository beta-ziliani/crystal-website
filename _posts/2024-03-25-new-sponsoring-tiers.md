We are making several changes in the [sponsoring tiers](https://www.opencollective.com/crystal-lang), to better adapt them to our sponsors. After carefully studying the options, we devised three different groups:

 1. Contributors: Those that want to help us develop the language and its ecosystem.
 2. Sponsors: Those contributors that also want to gain visibility.
 3. Corporate Sponsors: Those sponsors that also need support from the Crystal Team to help their business move forward.

From a practical point of view, we:

 1. Increased the minimum value at which links are added to the [Sponsor page](https://www.crystal-lang.org/sponsors).
 2. Added new options to boost the visibility of sponsors, like the [newsletter](https://crystal-lang.org/#newsletter) and [release posts](https://crystal-lang.org/blog/#release_notes), and updated the values accordingly.
 3. Directed Corporate Sponsors to contact us to better tailor a package that suits their needs.

We understand this is a breaking change. If this affects you, please let us know at [crystal@manas.tech](mailto:crystal@manas.tech).
