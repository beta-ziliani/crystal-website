GitHub added a new role to their repositories, the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization"><i>Triage role</i></a>.
This new role allows active participants to be granted access to add/remove labels, mark duplicates, and so on. This role provides a middle-ground between an eventual contributor and being a core team member.

Contributors that are granted the role are listed in the relevant section at the <a href="/team#triage">Team page</a>. If you are an active contributor of the project and feel you can level up your involvement with it, apply by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:crystal@manas.tech">crystal@manas.tech</a> with your desired role and GitHub handle. The application process might take up to a month.
